ðŸ‘‹ Hi there and welcome! This course will teach the foundations of computational design through the design tool Grasshopper.

![description](/images/4-1-1.png)

In this module we will cover some background on computational design and it's many use cases in the building industry. Then we will get our first introduction to Grasshopper and see how it works alongside the Rhino interface. Finally we will get some hands-on experience creating geometry in Grasshopper.

Once you're ready, click the `Next` button below to start the module.
