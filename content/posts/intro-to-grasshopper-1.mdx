## Ok, then what is computational design, and how is it different from just using a computer for design?

Computers have been impacting the way designers work since the arrival of the personal computer in the early 1980s. These days, computers are heavily integrated into the day-to-day work of almost every design professional. However, most designers still rely on out-of-the-box software solutions that come with standard user interfaces that support typical workflows for accomplishing specific design tasks.

Recently, however, a growing number of designers are going a level deeper to actually program computers to do more specialized tasks and leveraging the power of algorithms and computation to unlock new potentials for their creative design work.

When we talk about computational design, we’re usually referring to using a computer beyond the standard workflow created by a particular software. Traditional software is controlled through a visual user interface (UI) composed of elements such as buttons and text boxes which allow the user to perform a set of pre-defined tasks. Meanwhile, the core functionality of the software is hidden away from the user.

Computational design tools give users access to these core functionalities, allowing them to control the software directly through custom programs and algorithms. To build these algorithms, computational designers must be familiar with some level of computer programming, which is the practice of writing algorithms to describe specific tasks to a computer. Although computer programming is not traditionally thought of as a core design skill, as design workflows become more and more digital and complex, the ability to program design tools to do custom things is becoming increasingly important.

## What is computational design for?

Computational design is still an emerging field, with many new uses emerging every day. Some of the more common uses are:

### Parametric design

When you describe a design as a system rather than a static object, you can expose certain variables or parameters that control how the system works. Later, you can adjust these parameters to quickly change the design outcome without having to rebuild the entire model. For example, if you modeled a curtain wall the traditional way and the panel design changed, you would have to rebuild the entire model with the new design. But, if you described the process of creating the curtain wall using computational design (for example, take a single panel model and align it with a grid of points generated according to the dimensions of the building), you would simply input the new panel design and run the program again to regenerate the entire model automatically.

### Formal complexity

Creating a computational design system can be challenging and time-consuming, but once the system is defined you can easy run it many times to create a large amount of geometry and complexity, often much more than would be possible to model or develop by hand. The capability of computational design tools to generate an extreme level of variation within a given system was expressed strongly in the visual language of many architectural projects of the 2000’s when these tools first started to become available. While this kind of computationally-driven formal variation is still popular, the emphasis these days is more on how to make it buildable by tapping into similarly-sophisticated fabrication workflows.

### Performance-driven design

Another major advantage of computational design is that it allows the designer to easily connect their design models to computer simulation tools that can help them evaluate the performance of their designs (for example structural, environmental, or energy performance). Traditionally, each time a designer wanted to perform a simulation they would have to process their digital model manually for each specific simulation program. With computational design, the design is already defined through data, making it much easier to connect to simulation engines that run within the same computational design environment. This creates more immediate feedback and a much faster turnaround, allowing simulations to be used much earlier in the design process. We will look at two different structural simulation libraries that run within Grasshopper later in the course.

### Design automation

Because of it’s focus on breaking down and describing design processes, computational design can be used to build custom tools and workflows that automate some portions of the design processes. This can range from simple definitions that automatically add tags to particular objects in a model, to complex [optimization workflows](https://medium.com/generative-design) that can actually help the designer find optimal solutions to their problems given a set of high-level objectives. We will look at automation and optimization workflows in more detail later in the course.

Now that we know what computational design is and how it can be useful to us, let’s dive in and learn how to do it ourselves. One of the most popular tools for computational design is Grasshopper.
