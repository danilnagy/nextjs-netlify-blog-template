# Getting started with Grasshopper

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there and welcome! This course will teach the foundations of computational design through the design tool Grasshopper.

## What is Grasshopper?

Grasshopper is a computational design tool that works with the [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) program [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/). It allows you to create designs not by modeling the geometry directly, but by defining relationships between smaller processes that come together to create the final design. Using computational design in Grasshopper allows you to think of designs as systems rather than static objects.
