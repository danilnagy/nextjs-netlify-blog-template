In this exercise, we will continue to develop our tower model, this time focusing on creating a panelized facade system for the curving tower. In the digital world, there are few limitations on geometry, and modern CAD tools like Rhino and Grasshopper make it easy to model free-from curve geometries of high complexity. However, if the goal of the model is to design an object that will be made in the physical world, you must design with the constraints of the material and making process in mind.
