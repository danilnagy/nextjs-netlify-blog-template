## Multi-part variables

In addition to storing single pieces of data, you can also use variables to store many pieces of data, and then access them in a structured way. There are two basic types of multi-part variables:

- **Lists** (sometimes called arrays)
- **Dictionaries** (sometimes called key-value pairs)

### Working with Lists

A List can be created by using square brackets, and separating individual elements by commas like so:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas']
```

To retrieve an object from such a List, you once again use square brackets, but this time appended to the end of the variable name. Inside the brackets you place the _index_ or position of the item you want in the List. For example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[0])
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas']
print(fruits[1])
```

Notice that like in all languages (including Grasshopper), counting begins with '0', so if you want the first item in a list you use `[0]`, the second item `[1]`, and so on. Unlike many other languages, Python will allow you to mix different types of data within a single List, so something like this is perfectly legal:

```python
fruitsAndNumbers = ['apples', 2, 'bananas']
print(type(fruitsAndNumbers))
print(type(fruitsAndNumbers[0]))
print(type(fruitsAndNumbers[1]))
```

You can also use a `:` operator within the square brackets to obtain a range of values from a List, which will create a new list that you can assign to a new variable:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
newNumbers = numbers[0:3] # [index of first item:index after last item]
print(newNumbers)
```

You can even index backwards using negative indices. Here is a typical application that will print out the last item in the List:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[-1])
```

Lists implement various methods to help you work the data stored within. The most common is `.append()`, which adds a value to the end of a List:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)
```

You can even start with an empty List, and fill it gradually with appends:

```python
numbers = []
numbers.append(1)
numbers.append(2)
print(numbers)
```

For other common List methods you can refer to the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists).
